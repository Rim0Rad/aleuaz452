Stop at the Italian Chapel, where the Italian prisoners of the second war built this church with salvaged material. Thrilling. Walk to Hoxa Head and the Churchill Barriers really very interesting. Spotted the orcas right in front of Hoxa Head. Then run to see the sunset at the Ring of Brodgar. Today I screwed up with the weather!"

                text: " After sleeping well for the second night in a row, a more unique than rare occurrence, I thought I'd take a trip to Kirkwall. Deserted town and all closed on Sunday mornings. So I got on my faithful friend and headed to Yesnaby where I spent most of the day. I no longer know how far I walked, I took some risks to take some pictures, but the emotions were intense. Beautiful landscapes, nature that reveals itself in its essence. The silence and the wind that raises the waves, what wonderful places."+
                "Unfortunately it was not indicated well, indeed, there were no indications at all. I parked Danko, this time he just couldn't come with me, and I walked a lot to get to photograph the cliffs."+
                +"Then I sat down, in the cold and wind, and enjoyed the show. Sometimes I forget, while I am intent on looking for the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù photo, that those images must first be saved in my mind, and live in the moment, then afterwards leave the time to photograph."
                +"Then I left for Skara Brae where the oldest Neolithic site in Europe is located (5000 years ago - 3180BC). Stunning!"
                +"A quick jump to Earl's Palace and then to Broch of Gurness as it starts getting dark very early."
                +"During the coffee break we study where to go tomorrow."

                    "Spent night at Stromness port, slept 5 hours, ferry departure at 6:30.  Once in Scrabster I head towards Durness, along the famous NC500.  This time I decided to go anti-clockwise.  A group of young deer pass me.  I decide to stop and have breakfast and drink a hot coffee, maybe I meet others.  I resume my journey and as I drive west I feel the sun warm my face, it was days that I hadn't felt this warmth, what a nice feeling."
                    +"The landscapes are very different from Orkney, but impressive.  I had already seen this road, but I am still impressed by the beauty that appears in front of me."
                    +"The north coast of Scotland offers stretches of light sand, I want to swim, luckily I don't have a swimsuit!  ü§£"
                    +"Stop at Smoo Cave where I meet other friends in Van where I exchange greetings and a few words."
                    +"I decide to take a break and smoke a pipe and while I enjoy the sea, the rainbow appeared!  What a show!"
                    +"I resume the road towards Ullapool that I wanted to reach but I am too tired and I decide to stop after Unapool."
                    +"There is a very strong wind heading east."
                    +"Danko moves, I hope I can sleep tonight."
                    +"Technical note: I ran out of LPG from Orkney, I'm using petrol, but one tank is empty and the other has the level indicator that doesn't work.  I'm a little anxious ... Maybe tomorrow I need help!  "

                "Day lacking in strong emotions: Night passed very badly, the wind was very strong and Danko was moving continuously, and I don't know why, but I was not calm. The diesel heater was not working and will probably continue to not work, which means that between now and when I get home I will sleep in the cold. Patience, I'll cover myself."
                +"I leave for Ullapool and stop to look at the Stoerhead lighthouse. If I wasn't careful the wind tore off both the door and my arm! There was a panel offering the possibility of renting it. Good idea, maybe next time."
                +"I continue on the NC500 and now I don't count the deer any more."
                +"I'm confident gasoline will be enough for me to get to Ullapool."
                +"Trust was not enough, or rather, gasoline was not enough."
                +"Arrived 6km from Ullapool, penultimate climb, Danko greets me and falls asleep on the side of the road. Fortunately, he decided to stop at a secondary intersection where there was no one. he didn't warn me before. Bhum, dead."
                +"The first car that passed stopped immediately and accompanied me to Ullapool to get a 5-liter tank and then brought me back. Too much kind, the gentleman. I didn't ask him for his name and just thanked him. Now that I think about it I wish I could have done more."
                +"I leave with Danko and find that the Fish And Chips in Ullapool that I wanted is closed until 3 pm. Nothing, today is wrong."
                +"I go to get LPG and petrol and I meet two very young girls, who are backpacking and asking for a lift. I offer to give her a ride and we share a few kilometers together."
                +"They are French, luckily I speak French better than English and we tell each other a little about our lives."
                +"I cook some pasta and share it with them. They have some cold food that infuses my car with garlic. I open the windows. Souvenir photos, they are very nice!"
                +"I accompany them to Lochcarron, as they go Applecross while I make my way to Skye."
                +"I see the sign for Eilean Donan Castle and I decide to turn left to leave Skye for tomorrow, since it doesn't move from there. I take advantage of the sunset to take some photos."
                +"I am tired, I found a pub where I am having a beer near a stove and I feel all the warmth that embraces me."
                +"I begin to feel the desire to go home, or even to just get closer, but I know that tomorrow will be a great day and I hope the calm will return."

                "Last night in the pub a trio of men in their sixties were preparing their instruments. The music was the same one I had heard in the Robin Hood movie starring Russell Crowe. It was a nice surprise. I love pubs in the UK for that, you don't know what to expect."
                +"After the beer, I decide to come back to the parking in front of Eilean Donan Castle."
                +"I am looking for a solution to not sleep cold: I decide to fill the tank with diesel fuel (it was 60%)."
                +"I turn it on, I feel it runs well, it doesn't smoke. Guys ... it works !!!! Surely the problem is not solved but plenty of hot air comes out of the mouth."
                +"I fall asleep, in the heat, tired, in silence. I close my eyes looking the castle. I feel privileged."
                +"Woke up at 6.30 the first thing I do is look at the castle: it is in the dark. Sin."
                +"Porridge breakfast. I wash the dishes left over since yesterday, make the bed, wash myself, tidy up the van. Last photo. I turn on the engine, put the first gear and head towards Skye."
                +""
                +"I go towards Elgol and in front of me you can see the first mountains, a peak is slightly snow-covered. The landscape is wide, a large valley, I don't know where to look, I would like to take a lot of photos, but I decide to keep the view to myself. I feel like walking, I don't want to do it alone and I don't have time, it's already dark at 4pm. I find a tree that reminds me of Gandalf's staff."
                +"Return to the A87, towards Carbost, where the Talisker distillery is located. On the way I meet the Eas waterfall in 'Bhradain and shortly after the Sligachan Old Bridge where there is also a statue in memory of John Mackenzie and Norman Collie, two important figures in climbing. They make me want to smoke the pipe, I ask if they have any tobacco. They give me some of theirs, but they don't talk much. ÔÅä"
                +"I light the pipe and I head direction of the distillery. As I get closer, I immediately feel the unmistakable smell of the cereals used to make whiskey in the air. The distillery is closed for the public. I remember very well that behind the distillery there is a take away. I hope it's not as closed as Ullapoll's fish and chips."
                +"Fortunately, it is open. Nothing has changed. The guy at the checkout in a T-shirt (I'm wearing a triple layer and I'm cold) asks me what I desire. Today I feel rich: lobster and fish soup. (14 pounds in all, in Geneva I'll get a sandwich and a Coke). I've never eaten it, I don't know how it's done. I look it, I‚Äôm fear as an Aboriginal would look at a plate of spaghetti with a fork in his hand. Nobody looks at me, I can give vent to my animal instinct. I stick my fingers into the flesh of the carapace and devour it, sucking and not leaving anything out. Fortunately, there is a sink with water and soap. I'm all dirty and I smell fish. I wash carefully."
                +"In euphoria, I look at my map and see that there is a lighthouse (Ardtreck point Lighthouse). I head in that direction until the road stops. I know that I will have to walk. I climb over two fences, hoping that no one see me. There is water everywhere . I go slowly so as not to get wet and try to be careful. After 50 meters I also had frogs in my shoes! Luckily, I got rid of the thought, I am wet up to the ankles and I can walk quickly. I don't see the lighthouse, I walk, I walk, I walk. I go up a little hill. I see the lighthouse."
                +"‚Ä¶"
                +"No, it won't be that, I repeat to myself. Check google map. It is that. An abandoned old phone booth was more interesting. I decide that I have to see it closely. Up close it was even worse."
                +"It's windy, my feet are wet and a long way to go back to Danko. I turn around. I don't recognize the road. There is no network. There is no path. Bho ... I'm going, somewhere I'll arrive. Finally, stretching a bit, I arrive to Danko, take off my shoes, hang up my socks."
                +"I eat a banana. I go towards Dunvegan to see the castle: closed like the distillery. It's 3:00 PM. I wonder whether to go to Neils point. Spectacular place, breathtaking, but already seen 5 years ago, and revised on every advertisement in Scotland. I decide not to go there, I have already seen the beautiful Ardtreck point Lighthouse!!!"
                +"I go towards Portree, I shop at COOP. There are whiskeys on offer and I get one with an affordable price. The packaging inspires me, aged 12 years. I've already spent 14 pounds on a lobster, I can't exaggerate. I ask a big man if he knows him. He tells me it's very good. I put it in the cart."
                +"Even though I travel alone and am a lonely and taciturn, I enjoy talking to the locals. They are all sociable, serious but helpful."
                +"Arrive in Portree, choose the pub for the evening beer. In front of me there is a group of Italians. I don't pay too much attention to them. I would like the same music as yesterday, I relax by drinking my ALE."
                +"I need to decide where to go to sleep and what to do tomorrow."

                "Today is a great day. I read on my app (park4night) that there is in Portree a swimmingpool where you can take a shower for 3 pounds. I have felt the need for a couple of days."
                +"I wake up at 6:30 (warm) and after having had breakfast and tidying Danko, I set off with my bag and, chest out, happy at the idea that after a while I would be clean and fragrant."
                +"Closed. On Thursday it opens at 1pm."
                +"I return to Danko, hunched over and demoralized. I repeat myself, patience, I will continue to stink, I am so alone, I do not bother anyone, I wash somewhere. These is the VanLife."
                +"It rains, and it will rain all day. Perhaps the grayest day since I left."
                +"I turn on the engine, it runs well, everything is ok. I take the A87 north towards UIG where the Skye Brewery is located. Arrival, beautiful pier. Cars in line waiting for the ferry. I see a Pottery and jump inside. I see a woman intent on making a vase. I don't disturb her but I observe, and I admire. I look at the exhibits, beautiful, but too expensive for me."
                +"I go out, I see the brewery, chest out, I am convinced because I see the lights on. I arrive at the door. Closed until 10 .... GRRR ...."
                +"I get back in the car and go north to go around the peninsula."
                +"I encounter something that I have wanted to see for a long time, on my right I see the Skye Museum of Island Life. The wind and the rain show no signs of diminution."
                +"If you have the option, take the secondary road from Idrigil to Brogaig. It is as beautiful as the north coast."
                +"Past Duntulum, I head south, on the left I see a dirt road that climbs up a hill. I decide with Danko to do it, as I see it well marked and without risks. I put the 4x4 and the low gears. I go up to the top. I was right. Superb, I take pictures. The wind is impetuous. I think how to move and turn Danko to go back. I get bogged down. The wheels slip. I can't get out of there. Danko is tilt to the left. I‚Äôm in panic. The engine stops. I feel the heart coming out of the chest. The wind rages, the rubber of the windshield wipers makes noise with every passage and they are not even needed because it rains too hard. I'm in a panic. What the ‚Ä¶. did I do? For a photo? Now who's going to pull me out? I put my hands on my face and tell myself to stay calm. I get out of the car, look at the marks in the mud, try to figure out how to do it. Nearby I see some stones, I take them and put them under the wheels on the left. I go back up. I put the differential lock, I make sure that the low gears are engaged, I insert the rear and gently accelerate, I feel that the wheels are gripping. I take a bit of a run-up, insert the first. The tires hold and straighten Danko. I do the maneuver again, back and then first. I came out of it. As soon as Danko is level and out of danger, already with his nose pointing downhill, I stop. Scream .... ‚ÄúSIIIIII‚Äù, we did it !!!!!!! SIIIII, Danko, ti amooooo!!!!!"
                +"the heart slows down. I've decided, stop off-roading in Scotland."
                +"I'm going back to Portree, it's almost one o'clock. Now I need a shower even more, I think I smell more than one of the sheep that has been keeping me company for two weeks."
                +"Happy more than before, from the windows, I see the bath caps of the people who are swimming. I ask to take a shower, the lady at the reception speaks at 100 kmh/h (too fast), I nod my head but I didn't understand nothing. I ask her to speak slowly, she also takes off her mask. Now I really understand her. He tells me that to take a shower I have to have a bathing suit. I don't have a bathing suit, I answer. The lady of about 55-60 yo looks at me with her dark eyes interrupted only by the Plexiglas made specifically for COVID, and with a smile that I will never forget, she says to me: 'Please, protect your modesty'. I don't know what sense it makes in English, but in Italian I like a mess !!!!! Inside I burst out laughing but I try to hold myself and tell her: ‚Äúies ies, dont uorri, ai protect mai modesti‚Äù with my Italian accent! I'm dying of laughing even more. He must have taken me for an idiot, but it doesn't matter, I'm too happy."
                +"I take a shower, and soon from the euphoria, even shave. Showers are shared and you can see almost everything from the pool. The women intent on acqua gym with their coloring bath caps enjoyed the show. A woman who was taking a shower also told me (if I understand correctly), but I preferred not to deepen and think about my 'modesty'."
                +"I go out happy, perfumed, clean-shaven, deodorized, with a clean and ironed shirt. I am reborn. It continues to rain but inside I have the sun. What a cool it the VanLife I think."
                +"I go up on Danko and set off again, towards Oban."
                +"Before leaving Skye I see 3 small shacks selling local products. I stop, I buy a wool hat with the words 'isle of skye', an excellent memory for the beautiful day. Is gorgeous. 15 pounds. Colorful, as soon as there is a bit of light I put it on. I am happy."
                +"I leave, but the fatigue begins to be felt and it begins to get dark."
                +"The road is beautiful despite being cloudy, on my left and right I no longer count how many waterfalls I encounter, small and large."
                +"I stop in Fort William. I'll see Oban tomorrow, it doesn't move anyway."

                +"The mattress is a little wet, Danko plays these tricks on me every now and then and lets water enter the windows. Russian car, some small flaws, but I love it for that. The heating worked all night. I turn it off. My only concern is the service battery. It hasn't charged for days and now I need it to get the heating to work. I have to find a way to recharge it or I'll have to sleep in the cold."

I can smell the air full of water droplets. The sky is still gray, it has been like this for days. I miss the sun, I miss that warmth I felt when I got off the ferry in Thurso. I start the engine, remove the chocks from under the wheels. I stop for a moment to look at Loch Linnhe before leaving."

I take a careless tour, I look at the shops in the hope that something catches my attention but I find only things for tourists, objects without a soul that do not convey anything to me. I know I still have to do a lot of miles. I eat a Seafood box in yet another fish & chips I meet. "

                +"I know, I'm lucky. The beauty of Vanlife is to experience emotions that you would not otherwise feel. I feel close to nature, the earth, plants, water, the passage of time. The smells of the forest, of the fallen leaves, the rivers full of water, the wind that gives you no respite and has no pity on anyone."
                +"As I look at the road and the succession of landscapes, between mountains and rivers, I wonder what Scotland has given me."
                +"I say to myself: Alessandro, after all it is you who leave a part of you, here."
                +"But then I come to the truth: the truth is that Scotland and I are friends, we have been friends for a long time and between friends there must be a give and a take. I know it was like this. I left her a part of my heart as it had in the past, and she allowed me to live inside hers."
                +"We are equal; maybe I'm a little less sad or I just want to convince myself that that's the way it is."

                +"I went from landscapes where I saw only sheep to places where there are hundreds of people. I need to get used to it and I have to do it fast, but I know I won't be able to."
                +"We park Danko at the university, in a tree-lined avenue where the yellow leaves fall on the van's solar panels. The orange of the bodywork goes well with the autumn of York."
                +"Lidia decides to buy two bags of bird food. I think, or rather I hope, that the new generations are more sensitive to nature and to everything that surrounds us. In places like these you can't help but realize how beautiful the earth is."
                +"As soon as the geese and all the birds see that we have the bags of food in hand, they approach, voracious. There are those who are more bold and courageous, those who are smaller and more fearful, those who are smarter and even those who are more clumsy. We try to feed everyone a little but we know it will be impossible."
                +"The colors of the feathers are highlighted by the sun. There are some beautiful birds. I can stroke some geese while they eat the grains from my hands. First frightened, I let them eat while I try to feel the cold of their feathers, completely impervious to water. The perfection that reaches nature is something unattainable for man."
                +"Lidia tells me that there is a specimen of Chinese duck at the university. She knows where it is, we reach the small bridge where the duck is normally looking for food. It is there. I remain motionless to look at it. Is beautiful. Bright, lively, intense colors. I have little food left, but I manage to throw it to her. She does not come close, she is too shy and does not give confidence. I take this opportunity to take some pictures."
                +"The university also offers a splendid park, with plants from different parts of the world, as well as sculptures and the inevitable perfect, green and well-cut lawns."
                +"I let Lidia walk in front of me, we remain about thirty meters apart. For a few seconds I isolate myself. I stop. I smell the air. Fresh, clean, full of humidity. I feel the scent of the grass and leaves that are rotting under the plants. A disabled child in a wheelchair accompanied by his parents looks at me. We smile at each other. I wanted to tell him something, but they all passed in a second and I wasn't ready to say hello. Pity. I reach Lidia. She takes me to see a co-realization of her. A Living Room at the University of York, a great idea!"
                +"It is 3:30 pm. The poor breakfast in the morning is no longer enough. I am hungry. Let's get on Danko, I do some maneuvers because the branches of the plants are very low, I don't want to break them and at the same time I don't want to damage the solar panels. Lidia takes me to a Thai restaurant. The best of my life. Unfortunately, I don't remember the name of the dishes, but the prawns with curry were phenomenal. It's cold outside. In front of the restaurant there is a club. There is a queue outside. I see girls in skimpy dresses, dresses that are so short that even in the summer they would be too short ÔÅä I wonder how they can stand in line to enter a club without dresses and jackets, with summer shoes. Lidia tells me it's normal. Well, I'm cold with the triple layer. I think: 'I'm too old."
                +"As we exit the restaurant we head to the Christmas market, but I don't find anything that catches my attention. A lady in her 60s sees me and says: 'wow, what a nice jacket, where did you get it?'. I answer and thank her a little embarrassed. We smile and greet each other. I like the spontaneity of these people, I have found it in many English people."
                +"We return home tired, more from the cold than from what we have done. However, the journey that is about to end has taken away some of my energy. I have driven many, many kilometres and I need to stop for a few days."
                +"But this is not yet that moment."

                "The melody of the phone starts but I am already ready with my hand to turn it off. I put it 'early' this morning because I have an appointment in Dover where I will have to board the last ferry to Calais, around 11.30 pm. I don't have too many miles to go, but I would still like to visit something calmly and do some shopping before I leave the UK."
                +"I try not to make too much noise in the studio where Lidia and her boyfriend are sleeping. They remind me of when I was younger where I needed nothing but 4 walls and a roof. They do not even have a table to eat when they are at home, or they eat on the bed or on a sofa that is little bigger than a comfortable chair in a luxury cinema. They have the same space as a van, but in an apartment. I envy them, I wish I had their age, but the awareness of my age."
                +"I fold the blanket, pull the mattress, pillow and sheet up off the floor. I make sure I've taken everything. I open the fridge hoping to find something to eat, but I cannot find anything. I find the box of chocolates from Lidia's boyfriend, and I steal one from him, which later became two, but he doesn't know that he shouldn't leave sweets in a house where I am. I go to the bathroom to wash myself .... the phone alarm starts ringing again .... I leave the bathroom in a hurry but I make even more noise than the alarm clock .... this time I really turned it off, before I had it only muted. I turn to check the two: they are asleep, they haven't even moved. I stare at them and ask myself: ‚Äúare they dead?‚Äù. One of them makes a noise, and I understand that they are alive. Everything OK! I finish washing, take a slip of paper, a pencil and leave a message on the fridge, just two words of thanks. I will miss them. Melancholy takes me a bit. I arrive to Danko, and a smile is printed on my lips. I tell him: 'let's go home' and it seems to me that she replies 'We have been going home for days ...'."
                +"I start the 2.7 petrol, it runs well, I let it warm up, I load the luggage and on the GPS I type Peterborough."
                +"I mix with the English traffic, I stop for a milk and coffee on the A1. An overweight man is working on his PC sitting at a table. He reminds me of me when I was over 120 kg. I've seen too many obese people in the UK. I think of the statistics that I happen to read from time to time and there is actually something 'anomalous' compared to other European countries."
                +"I decide to finish my milk by driving. The sun is warm but the fresh air reminds me that it is winter. I arrive in Peterborough, I head towards the cathedral, there are many green areas: it is very beautiful and well cared for. I park along the street as some parking spaces are for cars only and I cannot access with Danko. I walk hastily towards the cathedral and I cannot help but be mesmerized by its majesty. Its facade is impressive, orderly, symmetrical. I love it. I go inside. A gentleman greets me with a smile and realizes that I am a tourist. He gives me a sheet with the history of the cathedral, he tells me that access is free but that if I want to make an offer, I'm free to make it. And so I do it. The cathedral is gorgeous. There are classes of children who are visiting it. I look at them, with their colourful backpacks and try to identify the child that I was as a child."
                +"The one always with his head in the clouds, who never listened to the teacher, who made more noise than the others. There is always a child like this and I like to spot him. In fact there is! Between me and me I wish him to be happy as I am when I travel."
                +"I conclude the visit and leave. Go and visit the cathedral, it's really worth it. Peterborough is a beautiful English town, with the inevitable central street, in this case a tree-lined boulevard with lots of shops and places to eat. I go to ASDA where I get some typical English sweets, one more jar of peanut butter, yet another packet of Stir fried vegetables, some mandarins and little else. I go back to Danko knowing that now there will be no more stops until Dover. I am very sad."
                +"I don't want to leave the UK but I just can't delay my return. I am tired and I need to rest."
                +"Arrival at the port of Dover, the directions are clear and precise. Arrival at customs. They let me out, I show my passport. I talk to the police, ask me a few questions, and politely authorize me to pass. I stop at the second check. They let me out, I open all the doors to see if I am alone. Then the policeman tells me: 'ok, everything is fine, now open the engine hood'. I answer him by pointing to the driver's seat 'I can't, the engine is inside the car, there is not engine hood'."
                +"He turns to his colleague and they signal me that I can leave. I smile under the mask knowing they've never seen a UAZ."
                +"I arrive at lane 116. The square is practically deserted. I feel more alone here than when I was on the Shetlands in the middle of nowhere."
                +"I go to have a coffee at the bar of the port and I tell the waitress: 'there are not many tourists in this period', she replies that there have not been many tourists for two last years. I smile at her and tell her that soon things will be as they once were. People will move and travel again."
                +"I am able to take the ship at 9:30 pm instead of 11:30 pm, so I can do a few kilometers in France before falling asleep."
                +"The ferry takes me to Calais in an hour, and I decide to immediately enter the motorway and stop at the first service station to sleep. Danko shows no signs of abating, I am very very proud of my trusted friend. We are traveling all over Europe and the United Kingdom will also be part of our memories."

                    "Last night before I fell asleep I decided that I would not set the alarm. The eyes would open when they would want. Not really a rational choice if the goal is to reach home 800 km away, but I know I wouldn't have slept for long. And so it was. I wake up at 7:30, with a little sore bones but I slept well, not hearing noises and, above all, in the heat. The heater did not give any problems and even the diesel was enough to ensure the warmth during the coldest hours."
                    +"I don't waste time having breakfast, I rush into the Service Area and immediately realize that I am no longer in my beloved Scotland. In addition to the inevitable baguettes, I see croissants in the front row. I say to myself 'Ah, yeah, you're in France'. Not that I had passed the idea of having breakfast with Haggis, but finding myself a single-color croissant and a ‚Äúcaffe au lait‚Äù in hand did not make a start with determination."
                    +"I pay quickly and on my way back to Danko I drink the milk and bite into the croissant. I turn the key, the engine starts for the umpteenth time without the slightest hesitation. WOW, I say. We are about to hit 6000km on this tour and you have been my best friend, never a complaint."
                    +"I drive along the A26 I can't help but stare at the sun. I look for sunglasses, but then I decide not to wear them. The light is not very strong and I can drive. If I tilt my head a little and straighten my back I can protect my eyes and this allows me to relax them when the light gets too strong. But I love the sun, the warmth it transmits. It reminds me of the trips I made in Greece when temperatures passed 40 degrees and I was traveling bare-chested with the windows open, completely deafened by the noise of the engine and the turbulence of the air inside the passenger compartment."
                    +"I continue south and I can't count the wind turbines, there are hundreds of them in the north of France. I see them on my right and on my left, all with their red light on the top that flashes highlighting their precise geometric and rectilinear positioning. Here too my mind takes me to the memories of when I was in Romania where I saw only one, it seemed almost forgotten in the hills of the Constanza district. I stopped under it to eat something and drink a coffee listening to the noise that the blades make when they turn pushed by the wind."
                    +"I love highway transfers. I do not experience them as a lost time, quite the contrary. Especially when I travel alone. Most of the kilometres I do without listening to music. Danko's reels spin fast but no less than my mind. I travel through the memories, into the emotions I have felt over the last few days, I think about where I will go and what I will do. What I could have done, the people I met, I think about who I miss and who I love. And the longer the transfer, the more I can relax and think about all this that makes me feel good. It's like going to therapy."
                    +"I know that I will not be able to stay for a long time in my brick house equipped with every comfort and lots of space; the sensations and emotions that I experience with my van are something special, something that not even a Caribbean resort could give me. They are different, no better, no worse, just different, but they are what I need in this period of my life."
                    +"The day passes quickly; my mind helps me not to feel the fatigue on the leg holding the accelerator and on the immobile back resting on the seat in water-repellent fabric. I decide to make a stop. I stop for a bite to eat at a motorway restaurant in the area dedicated to truck parking. When I stop, I always see men who are used to traveling thousands and thousands of miles every year. I think of the fatigue and life of sacrifices they make, but at the same time the luck they have in being able to see the world around us or even just a part of it."
                    +"While I'm standing upright eating another plate of Stir fried vegetables with a wrap heated on the gas stove, a bearded man with a bulky double chin tells me something. I understand that he speaks in Russian. He recognized the car and I am sure that he is telling me that in his country there are a lot of them but that here in Europe he has never seen it. Unfortunately, my knowledge of Russian is even worse than English and so I just have to give him my best smile and signal him to come closer and look at Danko more closely. He goes around the van, he still tells me something, but he too understands that it is impossible to establish a dialogue, especially if I don't stop eating my vegetables."
                    +"I prepare a coffee with the moka and immediately restart the engine knowing that I will only turn it off when I get home."
                    +"The trip to Scotland was superb, it couldn't be different. The encounters I had, the nature that proved to be very authentic, the food I tasted, everything I have tried in these three weeks have given me an overdose of memories and emotions that I will carry with me forever."
                    +"I'm thinking of writing a book, but I don't know if this is my path and if it is the right thing to do."
                    +"Thanks to all of you who have read me, who have written to me and encouraged me to do so again."
                    +"I hope I can meet you on the road someday, I'm the slow one in the orange loaf-shaped van."

                    +"You ask yourself many questions before leaving, you try to organize it in the best possible way, not forgetting anything. This time I didn't use my checklist, which is where I entered a myriad of things that I don't use most of the time."
                    +"This time I left almost careless of what I would need for the next few weeks."
                    +"Sure, Danko's been polished. I was in Turin to fix the LPG system which had failed upon the return of Scotland. I went to the mechanic to get the rear leaf springs fixed. I greased all the gears, checked all the fluids, made all the maintenance necessary to prevent any problems that may arise in a long journey around Europe. I used the diesel heater for many days in my house to check that everything was running smoothly."
                    +"The one who didn't prepare like the other times is me. I discovered that I don't have sheets for the bed, luckily the blanket and pillow do. Maybe I put the sheets in one of the boxes but for now I can't find any. I'll look better tomorrow."
                    +"Today was a beautiful day. Unfortunately, I only traveled a long way, but I met two people with whom I have been in contact for a long time on the internet. The first is Cristian, he had a flight from Moscow to Milan and then had to go to Brescia. I was on the road and made myself available to take him to his house. I went to Malpensa airport and accompanied him to Brescia. A fantastic man, a true man of the world, a true traveler. I will tell you about him another time."
                    +"Then in Mestre I met Alessandra. She had to abandon her Van Lifer adventures because months ago she had an accident where they destroyed her Traffic. Luckily she did not suffer physical damage, but the van was no longer recoverable and now she is looking for a new way to get back on the road."
                    +"It was nice to meet people live after you see them on screen for months and then all of a sudden you find them in the flesh. It was exciting."
                    +"The time spent with Cristian and Alessandra was too little, I would have liked to have talked more time with them, I'm sure there will be other opportunities in the future."
                    +"Alessandra advised me to stop and sleep near the 'Fusine lakes' before crossing the border with Austria."
                    +"I always welcome the advice of the people I meet. There is a lot of snow, but it is dark when I get to the parking lot. It's freezing cold and the heating inside the van works great."
                    +"Today I was unable to take interesting photos, but I am sure that from tomorrow the journey will take on a whole new aspect. I don't want to give away too much secrets right now."

                "A few minutes have passed since I opened my eyes and I hear a noise that I seem to recognize. It is the roar of an authentic, lively, exciting engine. The noise resembles that of an old fishing boat. A crackle that is amplified by an unfiltered muffler."
                +"Johann turned on his Uaz. As I look for my pants, I move the curtain of my van and catch his eye. We exchange a smile. He slept in his apartment in a warm bed, you can see that he is more rested than me."
                +"A few minutes later we are on the move to go to a flea market. I love this kind of markets because I come into contact with the most authentic people I can meet while traveling. There are always interesting articles, objects that have stories to tell."
                +"The market is located in a semi-peripheral area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKyev, the sellers place their items on makeshift stalls while the less organized place them on cartons or blankets lying on the ground."
                +"It is cold, the frozen and compact snow does not help to walk, it slips. Even though it is already 12h00 many sellers have not come. The snow of the night has certainly diminished the interest of potential buyers. Many vendors have preferred to occupy Sundays with other chores."
                +"A man with a thick mustache is sharpening his hatchets and proudly hands me one to hold in my hand. It is heavy, balanced, sharp. The man sees my approval on my face, but unfortunately it is an object that I do not need and, thanking him, I return it. We continue along the road as a diesel train whistles to warn of its passage. Dense black smoke comes out of the locomotive, the ground shakes as the freight train passes. Silence returns to the market as the last sellers arrived on the spot move the snow to make room for their objects, hoping to be able to sell something. I buy an old metal tank from 1951 with a Russian wording on it. If it's not rusty on the inside, I could use it for my van's diesel heater."
                +"The day passes too quickly and, after visiting the large second-hand clothes market, together with Svetlana, we go to have dinner in a typical Ukrainian restaurant."
                +"The next morning Johann wants to take me to visit an area not far from Kyev, to the north. Tchernobyl, as the crow flies, is only 100 km from Kiev. I would have liked to visit the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe accident but you have to prepare the documents and obtain the authorizations but, I don't have two days to wait for the clearance. Each with their own UAZ, we drive along the E373 and after about 60 km we turn right into a secondary road. The change of landscape is immediate. We are on a completely snow-covered road where tall fir trees cover the view on our sides. Johann stops to fix the front cover of his UAZ. We turn off the engines and the only noise I can hear is the strong wind that shakes the trees. The snow carried by the wind beats against my face, I breathe deeply and contemplate nature trying to understand the essence of that place. We are in an abandoned land. Dozens of villages are marking time. Wooden houses, many of them painted, are destined to succumb to the passage of winters. After a few kilometres, Johann stops along the road and on my left I see an isolated house, surrounded by coniferous trees. Johann beckons me to follow him. We walk in the snow and he tells me 'I lived in this house for 3 months, in winter'. I am speechless; I don't know what to say. There is a well to collect water. My friend tells me that winter is hard here, I don't doubt it. There was electricity, only two wires that came from no one knows where. Johann, even though very young, wanted to change his life. He has decided to leave his homeland and find himself in a remote place, far from everything and everyone. I didn't ask him why, I think it was none of my business. I think that certain choices are very personal and that they need to be told spontaneously. In this place, even if semi-abandoned, I feel that there is life. I can't see any animals but I am convinced that the forest is populated. The house, where Johann lived, is surrounded by objects, some buried in snow. An old oil lamp hangs from a gutter, while a totem guards what remains of the house. I guess what it's like to spend a winter here. I don't know if I would have the courage to make the same choice as my friend, but sometimes life puts you in a position to make choices that, at first sight, seem reckless and risky, but which in the end reserve the dearest memories you have to carry in the heart."
                +"We move a few tens of meters and find another abandoned house. I understand from the expressions on Johann's face that he has many memories lived in this forest. I leave it to his thoughts and enjoy the rustle of the wind blowing through the trees."
                +"After several kilometres we reach a small village. Time seems to have stopped. I see two children who are returning home with their backpacks on their backs. The cold is pressing, but on their faces there is no grimace of those who suffer from the cold. It can be seen that, even if very young, they are used to walking in this weather without caring about the snow on their faces."
                +"We  stop for lunch at an inn where they only serve a beetroot soup and some mashed potatoes. In a place like this, you can't expect much more, but the soup is hot and that's what we need. We return to our vans and continue on snow-covered roads between abandoned warehouses and factories. When communism was the only vision of these areas and before the accident at the Chernobyl reactor in 1986, there were farms and developing businesses here. The areas were poor but populated. Now everywhere there is a sense of desolation and abandonment where nature is recovering everything."
                +"Suddenly Johann stops on the street, gets out of his van and signals to me that he has run out of petrol. For kilometers and kilometers there are no distributors. Luckily I have the cans with me just in case. We enter an area bordered by two barriers. The police order us not to stop because the area is radioactive, it is not allowed to collect anything, hunt, eat on this stretch of road. It is a ghostly area. We meet 6-7 storey high buildings, completely in a state of neglect. There is no future here. Not for the next thousands of years. Not for us humans. There is a heavy air, as if I didn't feel wanted in this place. I want to reach the other barrier as soon as possible even if my eyes are curious and hungry to find out what was here until a few years ago."
                +"It is dark and I am very tired. Leaving the 'dangerous' area we come to a cafeteria where we have a coffee. It's time to say goodbye. Tomorrow I will leave Kyev, with its markets, the giant colored panels, the tall and sumptuous buildings of a capital that is squeezed between Europe and Russia, on the verge of war for no real reason. I hope nothing bad happens, this nation doesn't need to fight, it needs to live and grow."
                +"I hug Svetlana and shake Johann's hand which allowed me to live these two days intensely. I thank him and I hope to meet them again soon, perhaps drinking a beer by the sea, why not, in Italy."

I open the door and smell the air. It is no longer loaded with sand like the day before. I make myself a coffee and before leaving I decide to inspect the building on top of the hill. I open a door blocked with a piece of wood and find two ruined mattresses thrown on the floor. I close the door. I continue the tour and see a door ajar. Too dark inside and I decide not to enter. I take a step and hear a deep voice speaking in Arabic. I jump in fright. I thought I was alone in that place while instead there is an old man with a typical headdress sitting on the ground. He doesn't look threatening but he's not friendly. I don't understand what he says, I greet him and leave."

I continue to the center of the oasis where I park Danko and where an attentive boy is preparing the tables and chairs. I ask him if he can make me a coffee and after a few words I ask him if he takes me to see the canyon."

Now Danko is an oven, I have to quickly open the windows. I head to Tamaghza Falls. I see the sign and leave the main road. I insert the 4x4 and the reduced ones and start on the off-road route. I find myself among the palm trees following the river bed. Danko has no problems, the tires don't slip and I manage to get to the Golden Canyon through the mud and sand. I go inside until the road ends. I continue on foot. The path is narrow in some places. There is a ghostly silence and magnificent colors. The walls are carved out by water and wind. I turn to look at Danko and think he couldn't be in a better place. The path takes me above the Canyon where the view is spectacular. I can see the whole oasis in its grandeur. I go down some welcome dug into the rock and arrive at a small waterfall."
                    +"The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthrowing myself under the water lasts less than a second. I take off my shirt and enjoy the cool water that hits me on the back. It is wonderful and regenerating. I walk with bare feet in the stream and then return under the waterfall. Wow! I am in the middle of the desert, in an oasis and I can take a shower under a natural waterfall. I feel happy and full of life. I return to Danko and in a few seconds I am already dry. I head for the second waterfall. I stop to talk to a souvenir seller. I am in no hurry and I want to meet the locals. He fetches me a yellowed chair and offers me a mint tea. It is hot, sweet, fragrant. He tells me that there aren't many tourists now, he shows me videos of when the river goes full. He talks to me about all the people he met. He remains lying on the floor on his mattress while I relax sipping the tea that he has prepared for me. I greet him and continue to the second waterfall. There is nobody. I decide to throw myself back under the water and enjoy this gift that nature gives. I listen to the wind and the flow of water. It is regenerating."

                +"In front of me I see some dromedaries crouched waiting for adventurous customers and I can see the village in the distance. There are about ten white off-road vehicles, evidently it is a tourist area where agencies organize guided tours. I wait for everyone to take their pictures and leave. I am left alone with sellers of scorpions and stuffed snakes. I can't enjoy the moment because the sellers are persistent and despite being told no, I always have someone following me. I like to walk through the fake houses and imagine myself in the film with Obiwan and little Anakin. Allotment in a southerly direction. I stay on the site about 30 minutes. I love walking around these houses. I go back to Danko and move it to where the dunes begin, I am anxious to put the wheels on the sand but it is not yet time and I manage to stop before getting into trouble. I turn the wheel and after a few miles I find myself cutting Chott el Jerid, a salt lake. The landscape is ghostly. The road is straight and there is nothing around me. It is deafeningly hot, I check the engine temperature but Danko does not seem to suffer. I stop in the middle of the lake near an abandoned building used as a makeshift shop. I like being in that place. I take some pictures, I position myself in the middle of the street with a straight back and a long neck to see if anyone comes. Nobody. I see the scorching heat coming out of the street. I seem to see an off-road vehicle coming up against me but it's just the effect of the reverberation. I open the fridge and take a bottle of fresh water. The inverter is hot even if protected from the sun. I set off again taking care not to overheat the engine and aim for a constant speed of 70 km h. I put my hand out the window, there seems to be a hair dryer on that makes my palm hot. David Bowie on the stereo, Heroes, one of my favorite blaring songs. The engine runs steadily, a background hum that accompanies me in that salty expanse. It couldn't be more beautiful."

                +"My head is almost spinning, the heat is pounding and merciless. In the supermarket I meet a French couple who were also at the restaurant where I had lunch. I ask them if they have any information on how to cross a part of the desert and they tell me that there are some dunes that cover the track that leads to Ksar Ghilane. I decide not to take risks, I don't have another vehicle to accompany me and if I remain stationary I cannot take risks."
                +"After a short nap in the shadow of the supermarket, I decide to set off for Ksar Ghilane along the paved road. For very long stretches the road is perfectly straight, I could close my eyes and let Danko guide me. The sun begins to set and the colors of the sand are like the ones I imagined when I saw the photos of other travelers."
                +"I stop. On the side of the road piles of sand blown by the wind. I sink my feet and feel the grains envelop me up to my ankles. The sand is hot. The wind blows steadily. I would like to take this feeling with me and try to print it in my favorite scrapbook."
                +"I leave again but without haste and after a few minutes I realize that the sun is setting. I can't miss this moment and once again I stop in the middle of nowhere. The sun is about to hide and the colors are extraordinary. I get excited and take a selfie while I say 'Goodbye sun, see you tomorrow !!!!!'."
                +"I come to Ksar Ghilane. An oasis in the middle of the desert. We are out of season, it is late and there is no one left. I stop at a campsite for the night. I need a shower and I need to clean Danko of all (or most) of the dust that has entered."
                +"After a can of tuna and a tomato I start writing to the pc, already thinking about tomorrow and the dunes that await me."
                +"Updates follow."

                "Last night it was a nightmare. At around 11pm the current blew up throughout the oasis."
                +"Emergency diesel generators have started to work. The problem is that the generators were 30m away from me and the wind was carrying the exhaust gases right in my direction. It was too late to close the whole van and move away so I decided to put earplugs on. This morning I woke up in a bad mood."
                +"I prepare myself a good coffee, hot, sure that it will be good for me, both for the mood and for the spirit."
                +"Last night the national guard present in the oasis welcomes me and tells me that there is a spring of hot water. I realize that it is right behind the campsite and I go to see it. The water is incredibly transparent, there are only a few algae floating on the surface."
                +"There is a handful of French tourists taking a bath but I don't feel like it. Around the natural pool there are some small shops and a couple of bars / restaurants."
                +"A shop catches my attention and I decide to go inside, maybe I find something interesting. I take a walk and I hear myself called 'Alessandro'. I turn around and say ... 'yes?'"
                +"'Hi, I'm Ridha, how are you dude ?!' It takes me a moment to understand who I am talking to because in recent days I have written and talked to a lot of new people."
                +"I had contacted Ridha because I was looking for a guide to tackle the desert but then we had not found an agreement on the times."
                +"He asks me how I am and we exchange a few words about my trip and how he lives there in the oasis."
                +"He proposes to accompany me with Danko in the middle of the dunes. I am elated, excited like a child the night before Christmas. Ridha sees him and tells me to deflate the tires and get the car ready while he finishes his coffee."
                +"Soon after we find ourselves sitting side by side on Danko as we ride the dunes."
                +"I came to Tunisia for this experience. The sand is soft and Danko seems to float on it. It is difficult to explain what I feel, you have to live it. A few months ago I was at -20 on the frozen snow between Poland and Ukraine, while today I am flying at +40 degrees over the Sahara dunes."
                +"We head towards an old fort of Roman origin. A few stones remain but honestly I only have eyes for the breathtaking view in front of me. Impossible to describe what I feel. I would like to stop time. To remain with the lost gaze in the void. Counting the dunes. Look at them one by one to see which is the highest. Fantasizing dreaming of crossing a stretch of desert and then stopping for a night under the stars."
                +"I can not hold the sand in my hands, it is very fine and runs away from all sides. I take off my flip flops and try to walk barefoot. It is hot and I can't last long. I have to cover my feet. I climb a dune, I struggle but I want to enjoy the show from another perspective. The air is hot, we will soon reach 40 degrees and the sun is stronger than ever."
                +"It is time to return to the oasis. Now I want to jump into the pool but to my surprise I realize that the water is too hot to give me the pleasure of a regenerating swim. I greet Ridha and decide to leave the oasis for Chenini. I resume the road and, after 10 km, I come to an intersection. I turn on the GPS. Two choices, turn left and take the same route as the outward journey or turn right and extend by 30 min."
                +"Mmmm"
                +"Then I realize that in front of me there is another road but that the GPS did not option me, yet the area I have to reach is precisely in that direction. Right left? Where I go?"
                +"I put the first and go straight .... hahahahha I know, I'm crazy. In the middle of nowhere, two safe roads and I choose the one that the GPS did not have. I think I have water, food and gasoline and a bicycle to be able to move faster in case of help."
                +"A few kilometers after the asphalt gives way to a dirt track. Now I understand why the GPS did not suggest this third choice. I have to slow down but the spectacle that would open to my eyes is splendid."
                +"High barren hills remind me of areas of the far west, while some palm trees appear behind the curves."
                +"I am convinced that I have made the right choice. The petrol level is going down, but I have a 20 liter tank with me and I shouldn't have any problems."
                +"Shortly after I decide to stop. The sight that presents itself to my eyes is too good and I eat a coconut yoghurt sitting on the bumper. I hear only a few goats bleating in the distance."
                +"I take a sip of frozen water and thank God for taking me to that remote place in the Tunisian mountains."
                +"I continue in the direction of Chinini. A stone village perched on a mountain. The village is abandoned and the few residents live in lower and more modern houses."
                +"I walk nosing and poking my head through the doors made of palm wood. The rooms are small and carved out of stone."
                +"I manage to get a signal and I make a couple of phone calls to my family and share with them the joy of being there."
                +"The journey, the heat and the emotions have tired me. I need a day off and head to Djerba where I will try to spend a day on the beach before leaving for Italy."

There are other car signs on the sand and I don't see any prohibitions so I decide to get closer to the sea. There are few people on the beach and only about ten children bathing. The sea is gorgeous."
                    +"I spend the day writing to my pc and going for a swim to cool off. For lunch, the chef recommends a can of tuna. I don't need anything else."
                    +"In the evening, the beach is filled with families who decide to dine under the stars, and while I have nothing left to eat, I feel the splendid scents of Tunisian dishes in the air."
                    +"Around midnight I fall asleep peacefully and in the morning I head to Tunis to then take the ship that will take me back to Italy."
                    +"The crossing in the Mediterranean lasts 28 hours and finally I land in Salerno where I go to buy buffalo mozzarella, in a famous 'tenuta' (or farm) where they produce some of the best buffalo mozzarella in Italy."
                    +"Through the windows I can observe the cutting process and I realize that the mozzarella is produced in front of my eyes and immediately put on sale. I buy a dozen to take home, for my family and friends, and I decide to save one that I will eat during the trip."
                    +"I manage to travel 200 km before I get hungry and stop at a service stop. Danko parking in the shade and I look for the bag containing the mozzarella. I take a plate and as I am about to take my first taste, I realize that a smiling lady is looking at me."
                    +"I can't help myself and enjoy the first bite. An explosion of buffalo milk, an exceptional taste, a mozzarella never tried before. The blonde lady looks at the scene and does not hold back her smile and in English she asks me if she is good, already knowing what the answer is judging from my face."
                    +"The lady comes from Sydney and is touring Italy with her husband aboard a red Alfa Romeo Spider. I hastily tell her about my trip to Tunisia which is about to end and that I am on my way back."
                    +"In my hand I have my plate with mozzarella dripping with milk and I instinctively offer it a taste. I'll tell you where I bought it and the particularities of this mozzarella."
                    +"I look for a clean fork and cut off a piece. The same smile that I had a few moments before is printed on her face. She thanks me but she decides not to take any more as if she were afraid of taking a chocolate from a child."
                    +"In the meantime, her husband arrives who speaks a little Italian, and after her greetings they leave again in their convertible."
                    +"After my lunch I set off again towards Bologna where I stop under the Santuarlio della Madonna di San Luca in search of a bit of fresh air to spend the last night before arriving home."
                    +"The next day, a long-term transfer to the motorway, the Mont Blanc tunnel and finally Geneva, tired but happy."
                    +"I visited Tunisia for several reasons. The main one is the desire for adventure, to throw myself back into an experience I have never tried, the desert first of all. After 10 years, I wanted to relate again to a people of the African continent, who, although very close to Europe, certainly have ideas, traditions and foods that are very different from mine."
                    +"I was happy to have met and made friends with Tunisians I met by chance. I returned different, enriched, better than I left two weeks ago, and that was my aim."
                    +"I can't wait to leave for a new journey."
                    +"Thank you for following me in these stories!"

                    +"It was a tough week, like all the weeks of the last 4 months."
                    +"The new job doesn't give me a moment of peace. I was no longer used to such rhythms. Actually, I never had them like that. I went from two years of mental relaxation to almost 11 hours of work a day."
                    +""
                    +"But today is Friday, and in the parking lot of the company I work for, Danko is waiting for me. I've parked it in such a way that when I walk into the parking lot to pick it up, it stares me straight in the eye."
                    +"I get in, turn the key and say: 'let's go'."
                    +"Within a few minutes I manage to slip out of the Geneva traffic, making an immense effort. Those few minutes seem very long to me. I find myself in the river of cars of commuters / cross-border commuters who enter Switzerland every day in search of a higher salary than they would have in France. In the end, I'm just one of them, only I'm going in the opposite direction to home."
                    +"I left this morning forgetting even the blankets and a pair of shoes, so much was the desire to spend a night in the van. At lunch I had to go home to retrieve some personal effects, as well as the blanket, since I want to sleep in the mountains and I can't count on Danko's heating: it has already happened that it didn't work."
                    +"I want to reach Lake Gers, a place that was recommended to me by a friend of mine, Andrew. I have only the pants I am wearing and I decide to stop by Decathlon to buy a pair for the mountains. I appreciate it to stop at a hard discount store where I buy two salmon steaks, a salad and two beers."
                    +"The days are getting shorter, autumn is wonderful, but it brings with it not only the most beautiful colors of nature, but also the dark and the cold. It's raining, it rained most of the day. Can't complain about the weather. I look up to the sky, a few drops wet my face and I thank the clouds for cleaning this land. The drought this year was merciless. I don't remember anything like that in my entire short life. Now when I see the clouds I can't help but welcome them back."
                    +"I head towards the mountains, take a secondary, narrow, uphill road. There are no more cars and I can turn on the LED bar that beautifully illuminates the rain that falls in front of me."
                    +"Danko struggles to climb, the road is steeply sloping and at one point I see a deer crossing the road. The GPS makes me turn left where I enter a dense forest. The narrow road leads me to a small parking lot where the bridge that would have allowed me to reach the lake is mercilessly closed."
                    +"And now, what do I do? Nothing is seen around me. Pitch dark. I maneuver to go back and see that a small road parallel to the bridge leads to the other side. I can cross the river, it's not big, it's little more than a stream. I'm alone, it's late and I decide not to take any risks. I open google maps and look for a free area nearby to be able to park. I resume the climb from the junction I had taken and arrive at an exit station, Samoens 1600."
                    +"There is no living soul. I take a small road that takes me to the ski slopes. Dozens of roe deer run away illuminated by my lights. Turn away, they stop curiously to watch Danko trudging up the uphill road."
                    +"I park on the flat, next to a pond. There are no lights around me and it has stopped raining. I'm really lucky, I can go out and cook my salmon."
                    +"I open a beer and hear not far from me a river laden with water flowing downstream."
                    +"I don't see anything anymore, it's all dark, it's not cold for the end of October. I hope tomorrow to wake up and see a beautiful landscape in front of me."
                    +"I read a couple of chapters from a book I bought 3 years ago, then close my eyes and fall asleep."
                    +"I have been having major problems sleeping lately. I wake up most nights and can't sleep anymore."
                    +"I open my eyes, I turn on the phone and it is almost 8 o'clock. It starts to clear up and I am curious to see the view."
                    +"I raise a curtain and see the mountains. I'm happy. I am happy for sleeping, for the silence and calm around me. I need it. The heating worked very well and I decide to stay in bed for a while, waiting for the sun to reveal itself."
                    +"After an hour I feel like coffee and I decide to put on the new pants taken from Decathlon."
                    +"I open the door. WOW. How wonderful. in the distance the high mountains are white while the lake reflects the fir trees, like a still mirror. There is no wind, the clouds have left the blue sky free and I can smell the delicate scent of nature."
                    +"I need all of this. It is as if I recharge myself with energy, with a good mood, with joy. The last few months they emptied me."
                    +"Yesterday some of my friends, knowing that I was going to the mountains, commented 'Where are you going, it's raining, it's cold', as if the rain and the cold were a valid reason to hole up in the house. No, this is not me."
                    +"The coffee is ready. I add a little milk and decide to drink it standing up, admiring the view. I stand as if I want to respect the mountains. Like when as children at school they made us get up in class when the teacher came in (who knows if this is still done today?)."
                    +"Nature gives me so much that in this moment I feel I have to thank it by standing straight and admiring it with a smile on my face."
                    +"The sun begins to warm. God how beautiful!"
                    +"I generally try to explore the area I am in. I like to browse and feed my eyes of what surrounds me. But today it's different. I need peace, silence and to tell the truth what is presented in front of me is more than enough. I do not move away from Danko, almost with the fear of abandoning him."
                    +"I take this opportunity to make my Tibetan bowling sing. There is very little wind, just a slight breeze. It is a perfect time for meditation, with the stream in the background complementing the crystalline sound of the metal of the bell."
                    +"After lunch I can fall asleep. With closed doors, the orange curtains, now discolored by the sun, and the warmth of a warm autumn afternoon make me fall into a short, relaxing sleep."
                    +"I wake up after an hour and I think it's time to go home."
                    +"I start the engine and go down the steep road that leads to Samoens, I decide that I want to go back to the closed bridge which did not allow me to reach the lake of Gers. In fact, when I arrive at the small parking lot, I realize that a part of the bridge has collapsed and it is actually impossible to pass by car."
                    +"Next to the bridge I see the small road that goes down and from which you can go to the other side of the stream."
                    +"I decide to try and without hesitation Danko takes me to the other side and in a few seconds I find myself on the muddy road covered with deciduous leaves towards Lake Gers."
                    +"After a first uphill stretch, and with the first inserted, Danko points his nose towards the sky and I find myself admiring a breathtaking view, with snow-capped mountains only on the highest peaks. I enjoy the road, narrow and slippery. I stay as far as possible from the precipice and I think I did well not to try to climb the night before, it was raining too much and in the dark it would be too dangerous."
                    +"The road stops at the lake, I can no longer continue. There are a small group of houses, they are not abandoned, but their appearance would let you think. Everything is neglected except for a vegetable garden overlooking the lake. It is full in salads, neatly sown. The wood-covered shelter also needs maintenance."
                    +"A lady catches a glimpse of me, but she turns to the other side as if she doesn't like company, happy with that place now in the shade and away from the bustle of the city."
                    +"I check the phone, there is no network."
                    +"It's time to light my cigar, a Toscanello Speciale. I smoke it, holy peace, walking along the lake and taking some pictures."
                    +"It's time to go home, the one without the wheels."
                    +"It was a wonderful day, it was a long time since I had one like this."

                +"Around me I hear English and Romanian spoken. The bar is frequented by people of all ages. There are also two kids trying to peek at my PC."
                +"Last night I slept near the Red Lake, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Lake_(Romania) . I had already been there, many years ago, it was summer, full of tourists. I liked it, I remembered it was a lake in the high mountains surrounded by forests."
                +"My map of romania shows me a road that takes me to an isolated place, in a narrow valley. I walk it to the end and decide to park. I'm sure no one will come all the way here, I need to isolate myself. I need silence and not see anyone."
                +"I would like to light a fire but the wood is all wet and it's really not possible to find something to burn. After dinner I read a bit of the book that is accompanying me on this adventure and after a few pages my eyes close."
                +"In the silence of the night I open my eyes, I look at the time on the teledono and it shows 00.30. I still have trouble sleeping, I'm tormented by a thousand thoughts and I can't find the head of the skein."
                +"I turn around in bed, drink some herbal tea and after some time I fall asleep again."
                +"The alarm rings at 06.45. I want to try to take advantage of the light to drive and I don't want to sleep in the morning."
                +"I turn on Danko's headlights, it's snowing. What a surprise, yesterday the sky was clear."
                +"After a few km I decide to leave the paved road for a dirt road that takes me through the forest. Unfortunately, after a while the road is covered in ice and Danko's wheels skid. Impossible to continue and I don't feel like taking risks. I'm having a hard time going back. Danko saltire. I'm scared. I stop. I turn off the engine. I relax. I go out to check the situation and almost fall to the ground. I'm on a slab and you can't stand up. I try to figure out how to move and where to put the wheels so as not to end up in the ditch. Luckily there is gravel on the edges and so I decide to move slowly and the wheels regain grip. We come out."
                +"I opt for a second off-road route, I travel it slowly. I stop every now and then to take some photos, but the truth is that I want to stop to smell the air, full of humidity, and take advantage of the scent of the forest."
                +"The road is slippery, I walk it very slowly. I meet a group of loggers loading large logs onto a trailer. We say goodbye, they look at me curious."
                +"Once I reach the paved road I find myself in BƒÉile Tu»ônad, where a small orthodox church covered with paintings catches my attention. I park in front of the information office and I don't have time to turn off Danko, when a girl, dressed in all colours, petite, and with glasses comes out to greet me and ask if she can take some pictures. I'm surprised, I wasn't ready.... I smile back and tell her she can take all the pictures she wants. We begin to chat, she tells me about the church, the SPAs in the village, the swimming pools with hot water and the little train that accompanies the visitors."
                +"She is very kind, she wants to talk and we converse in French. She works for France Presse and every two weeks she goes to BƒÉile leaving her office in Bucharest."
                +"We say goodbye and after walking around the town, I return to Danko. As soon as she sees me she jumps back out of her glass box partially covered by tourist ads. We resume talking about her and I ask her if she would like to go to lunch together."
                +"She accompanies me to a small bar a little further on, where she warms me up with a local, hot and fragrant soup while she opts for a salad and rice. She tells me about her life, she doesn't ask me questions about mine. She seems like she doesn't want to get personal and she talks to me about her little girl by showing me pictures of her. I let her talk and enjoy spending time with someone local, Georgiana, that's her name, she's full of life and cheerfulness."
                +"I needed to meet someone like that."
                +"We know that we have to say goodbye and she senses that we would like to continue talking, but in my head I have Brasov and still many things to see. I just started traveling and I don't want to stop. We exchange phone numbers, take a picture together, and stick together in a long hug."
                +"The km I traveled to reach Brasov flew by, thinking about the beautiful day. It's time to enjoy tea."

                "The wind. This morning I was woken up by the wind. It was nice to come back from a deep sleep to the light of day woken up by the wind. A bit like when someone wakes you up by touching your shoulder and making you rock."
                +"I opened my eyes, lifted the faded orange curtain, and saw the branches stripped of their leaves moving under the gusts of the wind. I quickly got dressed and went out to find out where I had parked the night before when it was too dark to know if I had found a good spot."
                +"Yesterday, while trying to reach the R√¢u»ôor lake, I was stopped by the local police in a small village on the road, a few kilometers from the dam."
                +"They asked me for documents, both mine and Danko's. They asked me where I was headed. In the dark of the cabin I tried to get the map of Romania, and after turning on my cell phone to get some light, I told the policeman that my destination was Lake R√¢u»ôor."
                +"He looks me in the eyes and asks me:"
                +"'Why do you go to the lake? What are you, a fisherman? Do you know that it's cold in the lake?'"
                +"I am blown away and answer with a smile:"
                +"' No, I'm not a fisherman, I have nothing to fish with. I go to the lake to sleep, and I have heating in the car, the cold isn't a problem.'"
                +"He asks me what heat I have and he asks me more questions. I realize that they fail to understand what a life on the van can be, the pleasures of the freedom to move and to be able to sleep in unique places. I try to answer honestly, but I don't flatter myself that they understand. They give me back my documents and say goodbye."
                +"The morning has just begun, and the wind does not cease to subside, cold gusts blow from the north-east. Silence around me. I look around and see the lake with slight ripples on the water. The mountains are splendid, only on the highest peaks there is some snow. The air is clean, humid, I feel it on my face."
                +"Once at the dam, I turn off Danko's engine and stop for a few minutes to contemplate the landscape. It's amazing how what my eyes look at makes me feel good and how much it can recharge my spirit. I feel full of energy. For this I try to move and admire. From the dam I take some photos and it's a perfect place to fly the drone. The landscape from above is even more beautiful."
                +"I resume my journey with destination Tirgu Jiu, the landscapes are magnificent, Romania still has that rural countryside, which reminds me of the not yet modern, almost industrialized countryside found in Europe. But things are changing fast here too, maybe too fast."
                +"The km roll by and I see small plots of land some haystacks, the same ones painted by Monet in his paintings. Small ramshackle farms with fat foraging hens, barking dogs, the luckiest farmers can boast of having a cow or two. The half-ruined wooden fences that should delimit the property enclose a picture that reminds me of the countryside when I was a child."
                +"At one point I find myself lined up and the traffic suddenly slows down. I don't understand what happened. I go around a hairpin bend and see a line of trucks and vans, wrapped in a cloud of whitish smoke. I try to understand if a vehicle is on fire but after a few moments I realize that I have just arrived in MorƒÉre»ôti, famous for its Mitiei cooked on the grill. A dozen restaurants on the street have their own grills and all cook on the grill, charging the air with the smell of greasy garne. I find a place to stop and I don't give up looking closely, it's also lunchtime."
                +"Dozens of tables occupied by truck drivers, families with children consume their steaming milds. I sit in the restaurant opposite Danko, and to my right a Romanian woman sitting at a table with her family. She is about 30 years old, a little blond son intent on biting into her sausages. She's dressed in a cheap pink chenille suit, but what I can't help but notice are her lips, swollen like two tank tops, probably silicone or filler. I wonder how a man, or even a woman, can like such 'artificial' lips, but I'm not here to criticize another country's culture, I'm here to get to know it."
                +"I haven't found a single woman in my entire trip to Romania or Moldova who didn't have perfect nails and manicure. It's difficult for me to understand this exasperation in nail care, in general aesthetics so brought to the limit of good taste."
                +"Finished my dish of Micii or Mititei (two names that indicate the same dish) I resume my journey to Tirgu Jiu."
                +"I arrive in the town in southwestern Romania when it's dark by now, I'm tired and I need to take a shower. I decide to go to Booking and get an apartment for 25 euros. Tomorrow will be the last day of my trip to Romania."

                    "It's been a long time since the last time I sat down to write. Too long. I don't know if I've missed 'traveling' more or 'writing' about my travels. Probably the two things go hand in hand, and I can't do one without the other."
                    +"I lift the screen of my notebook, slightly curved. The keys don't work very well. I have to press some of them twice because the first time the letter I want doesn't come out. He has accompanied me on many adventures, and he is doing it again this time. Luckily, the screen doesn't have any defects, not for now."
                    +"This time, I feel prepared for the journey I have just started. The desire to leave, to escape from everyday life, from the more or less imperative duties, made me travel in my mind long before I turned on Danko's engine yesterday morning."
                    +"The preparation of the VAN has been long and laborious. I made several mechanical modifications, and in the last few weeks, I was always nervous and worried, hoping to finish the work on time so as not to postpone the departure."
                    +"On Sunday afternoon, when I was still at home, the day before leaving, after completing all the work and cleaning Danko in every part, I sat in my place, the driver's seat. I swear I felt like Han Solo when he got back on the Millennium Falcon in the latest Star Wars trilogy. A smile and a joy that melted me and made me say, 'Danko, we're ready, let's go to Norway.'"
                    +"The next morning, I set off with the goal of covering at least 1000 km. The GPS tells me that I have to cover 1590 km to reach Hirtshals (in Denmark). I want to split the first leg into two, but Monday is the longer one. On Tuesday, I have the ship sailing at 10:15 p.m., so I want to have time to arrive, prepare for the crossing, and do some shopping if necessary."
                    +"I drive along the highway in Switzerland and Germany. Fortunately, the highway is toll-free because the keyword for this trip is 'economy'. I have to try to spend as little as possible, and Norway is certainly not a cheap country. The journey is quite boring. Danko travels at an average speed of 90 km/h with peaks at 100. As always, some drivers wave at me while overtaking, and I admit that it pleases me and makes the journey less empty. At 11:30 p.m., I decide to stop. I've covered more than 1000 km, so I can close my eyes. I'm tired, and I fall asleep quickly."
                    +"The alarm goes off at 6:40 a.m. on Tuesday, June 6, 2023. The sun is already high. The days are incredibly long. The sun fills me with energy and life, as if I were a solar panel."
                    +"I cover the last 550 km and arrive in Hirtshals in the afternoon. A small fishing village. Not many people around. Low houses. The shop is already putting away the souvenirs at 5:30 p.m. and getting ready to close. I barely have time to enter a couple of them, but there's nothing that captures my attention. I'm tired, perhaps more today than yesterday, but I've reached the end of the first leg anyway."
                    +"I don't know what to do to occupy my time, or maybe I know what to do, but I don't feel like doing it."
                    +"On July 1st, I have a Spartan Race in Morzine. A very tough race, especially if you're not trained. I'm in that situation. I haven't trained much lately, and I promised myself that on this trip, besides 'economy', the second keyword was 'training'."
                    +"I don't feel like it, but it's the perfect moment. 20 degrees, little wind, the sun still high, the sea in front of me, I have 4 hours separating me from the ship's departure. I need to react. I head towards Danko, open the back door, look for the right clothes, put on my running shoes, and start. Yes, I did it. I started. The hardest part is over. I'm incredibly happy and start running along the main road, towards the West. The houses end, and I see a little hill with a lighthouse on top overlooking the sea. I see a path a few meters from the sea and decide to follow it. WOW, what a spectacle, the view is splendid, and I hardly feel the fatigue when I have to run uphill. My feet follow one another, even though I don't know where I'm going. The watch tells me I've done 4 km, and I have to start heading back to the parking lot. There's a bit of mist on the sea, perhaps fog, but the landscape is still stunning. Sometimes the horizon reveals itself when the clouds let the sun's rays pass. I don't feel the fatigue. It's amazing; I did well to decide to run a bit."
                    +"I pass by small blue wooden houses. A shirtless man sitting on a bench is contemplating the sea. I raise my hand to greet him, and he returns the gesture without taking his eyes off the horizon."
                    +"When I reach the parking lot, I quickly start Danko because I need to wash up and eat, but not in the center of the village. I head to the lighthouse where I can stop in solitude, wash up, and cook myself some chicken noodle soup."
                    +"An adjacent building to the lighthouse serves as a picnic area. It's sheltered from the wind, and there's free WIFI! I manage to post some photos on Facebook and Instagram while slurping my boiling noodles, splashing some on my shirt!"
                    +"I think about how boring these two days of transfer have been, and how enough to turn two 'lost' days into an unforgettable memory. I'm tired, but happy."
                    +"It's time to head to the port and prepare Danko for the night. I will arrive in Norway tomorrow at 2:00 a.m., and I don't know yet if I will go to sleep."
                    +"At check-in, I just need to present my passport, and they let me in. No checks. Perfect. I line up at number 67 behind a row of off-road vehicles and vans."
                    +"Danko is leaking a bit of oil; I decide to check it. In the coming days, I'll have to take some time to tighten all the engine screws, even though I think the problem is something else."
                    +"They signal us to start the engines; it's time to board. We're off. Norway, see you soon."
                    +"Updates to follow..."

                "I find myself wandering around the ship looking for a shower, but even at the reception they confirm that there isn't one. I would like to wash my hair after yesterday's run but it's not possible."
                +"I sit down to write and shortly after I try to fall asleep to rest until I arrive in Larvik."
                +"The ship arrives on time at the port and I'm lucky enough to get off first because I was parked together with the trucks."
                +"The customs check was very fast, in 5 minutes I find myself in the direction to refuel with LPG. Here in Norway there are very few petrol stations and I have planned where I have to fill up."
                +"Shortly after I find an isolated place in the middle of a wood where to sleep. It's 3 in the morning and I have to fall asleep quickly, tomorrow I have a lot of km to do."
                +"I hear the birds singing and I don't know what time it is. the clock tells me it's 8. I can't stay in bed anymore. I drink a hot coffee, two scrambled eggs and shortly after I find myself in the direction of Odda."
                +"The roads are well maintained, winding but you maintain a good speed (max 80km/h), perfect for enjoying the many lakes that immediately characterize Norway. The air is fresh and the window is half open. THE scent of the forest this morning I remember well, while now the air is neutral, fresh and clean."
                +"I still feel tired from the long transfer that took me from Geneva to the Norwegian port of entry. I feel like I'm running too much. Always run. I need to stop. I feel like I'm fighting against the clock and I'm not enjoying it."
                +"On my right I see a beautiful body of water. I decide to stop in the rest area and make myself a coffee."
                +"I check under Danko and see that he keeps leaking oil. I'm worried. I'm not calm at all. The mechanic who did the work on Danko didn't do everything as he was supposed to, I'm convinced of that. I check the oil level and I realize that it is missing a little."
                +"I can't enjoy hot coffee, even if I accompany it with a piece of dark chocolate."
                +"I want to continue, but I'm not serene. Difficult to drive when there is a problem with the vehicle that is your home, and is also your friend."
                +"The landscape is gorgeous. Along the way I keep passing lakes and waterfalls, one right next to the road, so close that it wets the road surface and I have to hit the windshield wipers to continue."
                +"I go down to take a photo, and the air is full of micro droplets of water. There are a lot of people, it is the beginning of the tourist season, but I seem to be already in the 'traffic' of August."
                +"I exchange a few smiles with some Korean cyclists, I can tell by the flags they have on their bikes."
                +"A few km separate me from Odda. The village was home to a Netflix series. Ragnarok. It's not the most beautiful series in the world, on the contrary, while I was watching it I said that the acting left a little to be desired, but I liked it. I'm actually waiting for season 3 to come out, but I doubt it was successful enough to continue. The series tells of a boy who should be the Thor of today. I don't know why but on Netflix, the village is called Edda. I recognize the supermarket where the cashier tells 'Thor' that something is going to happen and to be on guard. I go in and expect to meet the Netflix cashier, but instead I find a boy of Indian origins, rather short, with a mustache. I hope you don't reveal to me that I am the reincarnation of an Indian God‚Ä¶"
                +"I walk around the shelves but I don't buy anything and I go out with a smile."
                +"After walking in the main street, practically deserted and with the shops already closed, I go back to Danko and point to the parking lot where I will sleep before the ascent to Trolltunga."
                +"The parking is very expensive, practically 27 euros for 24 hours. The thing that makes me angry is that there are no alternatives. Ok the service, the nice place, but if I don't want to pay for the parking you offer, I would like to have the possibility to park further away, but for free. No, there is no other place here."
                +"Today has been a long day, and I fall asleep realizing it's never dark. Even around midnight the light is still very strong. Danko has nice curtains that protect me."
                +"The following morning I take the first bus which for 13 euros takes me from parking 1 to parking 2 and then I take a second minibus which takes me from parking 2 to the beginning of the walk, for another 8.50 euros, for a total of 6 km by road (21.50 euros only one way). Ok, I'm stingy, I've been told that Norway is expensive, but here it seems to me that we are exaggerating. I try not to think about the money spent, even if it's impossible for me since I would like to save on this trip."
                +"I'm not in a good mood, my head is full of bad thoughts. I had bad dreams about my previous job. Dreaming about my former colleagues is the last thing I want. I walk, but I have no mind free."
                +"The path that takes me to Trolltunga is long but easy, with a slight slope. After a certain altitude the snow begins to be a lot. You walk along the tracks of those who have passed before me. I'm dressed well, I can protect myself from the sun rather than from the cold. After three hours and 10 km I arrive at the fateful point, famous and reproduced in all the guides of Norway. Too many, too many people, all taking the same photos. I try to contemplate the landscape but it is difficult for me given the crowd. I move a few meters and decide to fly the drone."
                +"The view is breathtaking, I understand why they advertise it so much. I take some photos with the drone and immortalize a girl of Asian origin. I took a nice picture of her and I decide to go to her to tell her and to give it to her."
                +"I approach her and her boyfriend. I greet them and explain that I have some photos to share. They look at me warily, body language doesn't lie. They almost seem intimidated and it seems that they want to leave out of fear. I explain to him that I don't want any money, it was just a coincidence that she was there at the time and that I can send her the photo on Instagram. She said yes, but her distrust was evident."
                +"I can't know what went through her mind and what she really thought, but I felt like I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. I had a nice thought, I think, and instead I had an almost repulsive reaction. I try to find an explanation for all this, when instead I should just enjoy the place without worrying about anything else."
                +"It's time to go back to Danko's, another 10km awaits me and then I'll ask for a lift to P1 because I'm not going to pay for the bus again."
                +"Luckily two German guys stop with their super luxury WV T5 and accompany me to my super Rust Russian 4x4."
                +"I'm tired, not very tired. I drink a beer, have dinner and go to sleep closing the curtains tightly."

                "Once the household chores are done, I head towards Vik. The landscape is almost identical. It's almost monotonous, but that monotony doesn't get boring. Everything is beautiful, tidy. Not too much like Switzerland, artificial. Here you can see that there is the hand of man in the landscapes I encounter, but I still see the predominance of nature. Instead, in Switzerland, when I happen to admire the landscapes, everything is too perfect. All too tidy, aligned, clean, stuck, artificial. Switzerland is a bit 'too much' for my tastes, while here in Norway I still feel the harmony between nature and man."
                +"By now I don't even count the waterfalls anymore, I almost don't pay attention to them anymore. All the valleys I travel through have waterfalls on both sides. And I'm not talking about small waterfalls, I'm talking about thousands of m3 of falling water and wet the underlying rock. What a show! I think of the water shortage that afflicts Europe. Well, I think they don't have such problems here."
                +"I arrive in Vik and in the distance I see a beautiful wooden church, typical Norwegian. All dark, almost black. I leave the main road to get closer and after reaching it I would like to visit it but I see that the entrance fee has to be paid. I refuse to pay, as do the retired couple in front of me. I am a Christian Catholic, a non-practicing believer. I wish places of worship were free, for me and for everyone. I refuse to pay an obligatory offering to enter a place where I would first of all go to pray. I want to be free to choose whether to pay. I would like it to be explained to the tourist that an offer can be useful for the maintenance of the church, and that it is everyone's good heart to offer what they want."
                +"When he went to Vietnam, or Burma, I don't remember, some entrances to sacred places were paid for tourists, while free for those who went to pray. Again I did not agree, I pointed it out and left, disappointed."
                +"The church rests on a small hill, in an area overlooking the valley with a view of the fjord. Next to it is a small cemetery with very thick bright green grass."
                +"I take the opportunity to fly the drone, being careful not to hit the spiers or any nearby cables."
                +"I continue on the road and shortly after I take a small ferry in Leikanger, which for 8 euros takes me to Belestrand. I take a stroll along the marina where three teenagers are eating brioche, inviting but I try not to show that I would like to eat them too!"
                +"Danko keeps leaking oil, and my morale is on the wane. I'm seriously considering abandoning the trip and going home. I continue to have my mind tormented by doubts and fears. Fear of breaking something, fear of not reaching its destination, fear of having to call for help. Traveling like this is tiring, stressful, it takes away the desire and the pleasure of discovering new places."
                +"I follow the road and find myself flanking a frozen lake. The landscape changes drastically as you go up in altitude. At sea level it is all green and lush, as soon as you go up, it becomes all white and frozen."
                +"A group of campers draws my attention and I stop to admire some waterfalls. In the meantime I check the oil and the leak doesn't seem to decrease. Morale is underfoot. I call Cristian, a friend of mine who is making a very long journey with his UAZ and he cheers me up. He tells me to hold on, that everything will be fine. I listen to it, and I head to Forde where I find a supermarket where I buy 12 liters of oil. If the situation gets worse, at least I'm not left dry."
                +"I want to change my way of thinking because otherwise this journey becomes a pain. Come what may, I'll do something. I go back to the road I had traveled until I find a lake, where I take advantage of a table to stop and get myself something to eat. The water is still, a group of guys are joking and one of them seems to want to take a bath, but I'm intent on typing on my laptop and I don't realize if he really ended up in the water."
                +"I rearrange the dishes, Danko, prepare the bed and go to sleep not caring that on the other side of the lake there is the road and you can hear the cars passing."
                +"I wake up rested, last night I don't remember having dreamed. Today will be a beautiful day. There is enough oil in the engine and I have a large supply with me."
                +"I continue the road stopping at the most impressive waterfalls, remaining however amazed by the nature of these places."
                +"Once in Olden, just after a bend I see a cruise ship ahead of me. I hadn't realized that I was at the edge of the sea, and not a lake. I begin to cross couples of old men, and the closer I get to the ship the more there are elderly people intent on walking and holding each other up."
                +"More like a floating geriatric hospital than a cruise ship, I think."
                +"In any case I know they are good, certainly a lot or better than spending your old age sitting on a balcony complaining about noisy neighbors."
                +"I want to take the road that leads to Hijelledalen. My Norwegian friend and colleague Lars yesterday recommended a road traffic application to me. The app tells me that access is free and so I climb to the top. Unfortunately when I get to the top, a local man directing traffic tells me the road is closed. Not bad, the landscape is wonderful and there is also a functioning ski lift. There are a lot of skiers intent on their jumps. I don't have time to make a coffee, I take some photos and go down the tunnel instead of going from above."
                +"I arrive in Geiranger, a famous port in one of the many Norwegian fjords. The landscape is like a postcard."
                +"Norway is a continuous ups and downs. First of all you need to always have perfect brakes. The car is put to the test on these roads."
                +"I realize that the reverse camera has stopped working and after checking, the negative cable has come unhooked."
                +"While I wait for the ferry in Eidsdal I have time to repair it in a hurry. I take out the box with the tools, and as if by magic I can find only the tools I need: scissors, pliers, tape and screwdriver. The ferry is about to open the hatch to board and I manage to fix the camera a minute before boarding. I think: I was good, and lucky."
                +"The crossing takes a few minutes and immediately after I'm in the direction of Andalsnes, but I decided to stop in the snow and sleep at high altitude. I cook myself salmon, broccoli and sweet potatoes. I'm feeling lucky. Today was beautiful, I woke up positive and so it was."
                +"I walk on the road admiring the snow-capped mountains. The air is crisp. The journey took a different direction. I hope to sleep peacefully."

                "PART 1:"
                +"Although it's in the mountains and around me it's almost all white, it's not cold. I'm used to feeling much colder temperatures when I have a similar landscape in front of my eyes, but it's also true that we are in June, and in the Alps near my home, at 1000m there hasn't been any snow since January. My first concern is to check when Danko's oil has leaked and to my surprise the level has not gone down. I don't understand, but, right now, the result is what matters. I close the engine compartment with healthy optimism, and after two eggs and a hot coffee that reminds me of home, I start the engine. I look at the Norwegian mountains once again and go down the other side of the pass."
                +"After only two km the landscape has completely changed. I find myself in a narrow valley, lush, green, covered with coniferous trees, imposing waterfalls on both sides. The road is deserted. Gusts of wind carry water on the road surface. I can stop with the excuse of taking a picture, but what I really want is to capture this beautiful landscape with my own eyes. These spaces, these colours, the roar of the water digging into the rock are the most beautiful memory I can take away from the Norway I had dreamed of. I go down again for the many hairpin bends and I reach a campsite where at the entrance there are Troll scuptures, not threatening, indeed, almost comical. The souvenir shop is sadly closed, but it's Sunday and it's still early. I can't expect it to be open."
                +"In my last job, for 8 years, I have been dealing with roofs. Management of roofing construction sites and I have followed the preventive and corrective maintenance of hundreds of roofs. So, out of a professional spirit, it comes naturally to me to look at the roofs of houses. I am amazed by so many buildings here in Norway that have pitched roofs covered with greenery. I love them. I would like to know the construction technique, the materials used, how they are made, the costs, the maintenance. I try to understand their secrets by looking at them, but I'd like to meet someone who works there so I can ask some questions. If it happens to me in the next few days I'll stop and ask."
                +"Arrival in the town Molde. There is nobody. My mind takes me back to when there was Covid and the lockdown. Nobody, nobody. The modern town, well cared for, buildings about 10-12m high. In the main street clothing stores, household items, banks. All closed. Nobody. Silence. I walk along the road with first gear engaged without pressing the accelerator. I let Danko set the pace. I look in the mirrors if someone arrives but I continue to be alone."
                +"Will Smith's film 'I Only Legend' comes to mind. A spooky town. I pass in front of a cafeteria and I see that there are two people sitting at a table intent on sipping a coffee. They see the orange van and stare at me, we nod."
                +"I decide to park and walk around to capture an area with WIFI."
                +"I manage to call home, post two pictures on Instagram and go back to Danko. Today, for me in this town, there is nothing. When a 60-year-old gentleman came to look at Danko, he turns around and asks me if it's mine. He likes him a lot and he asks me the usual questions. We say goodbye but before leaving he asks me if I went up the hill to see the view. When I reply that I have not, he tells me that I absolutely have to go."
                +"I always listen to the advice of the locals."
                +"I get to the top. He was right. WOW what a view. All in front of me mountain ranges as far as the eye can see, with the sea below. The mountains seem suspended between the clouds and the calm sea, cut by the ships that don't stop even on Sundays. I sit on a bench and rest in contemplation. I don't remember seeing such a panorama in my entire life."
                +"I go down the hill and proceed to Trondheim where I stop among the Skarvoya islets, also famous for the bridges that connect them. I look for a place to park, I pay attention because there are many campers and I find a narrow place. The camper on my left decides to leave, I haven't gotten out of Danko yet, and the idiot who is aboard his camper doesn't realize that he hits my mirror while swerving. Before he touches him I start honking the horn, but he continues without stopping and my mirror scratches the whole side. I stay with the horn pressed for 15 seconds. Everyone present turns around but he doesn't stop."
                +"I get out of Danko, make sure I have no damage and straighten the mirror. The idiot doesn't stop. A bus driver who was present witnesses the scene and he too is incredulous. He asks me if I have any damage and luckily I have no sign. I'm angry, he didn't even stop to apologize or make sure there was no damage. Surely on his vehicle the signs of our encounter have remained."
                +"I take a walk, but I'm nervous and want to leave again."
                +"I stop after a few km, and after having traveled a small dirt road, I reach an inlet where small fishing boats dock."
                +"I can calm down. I see the perfection of that landscape. It's all where it needs to be. It is clear that there is work in that place. It's a little messy, but it's clean. Wooden shacks, definitely fishermen's shacks for inside I see the fridge for fish. Two seagulls looking for something to eat. The still water and the air that smells of brackish. I eat a cracker with sunflower seeds and the only noise you hear is my teeth crunching with gusto."
                +"I travel another km and arrive in the town of Trondheim, where everything is closed here too, but there is a living soul. I have a fish and chips, with two other seagulls keeping an eye on me. I instinctively turn around and protect my fish, I'm afraid they'll steal it and I'm hungry, I don't want to share it with birds, my first Norwegian purchase!"
                +"I take the small portion which is more than enough for me."
                +"I'm not interested in the city, especially if everything is closed, and after a quick walk I get back on the road."
                +"Once in Buvika I decide to stop and through Google Maps I find a parking lot by the sea."
                +"I still have the strength to fix a light bulb and check the electrical system. Everything OK!"
                +"After eating a tomato salad, I close my eyes and fall into a deep sleep."

                +"The following morning I decide that I have to go to Lofoten, and get there as soon as possible."
                +"I leave in the direction of Bodo and drive on the E6 without worrying too much about the views, which, although wonderful, lose some of my interest since I want to reach the port where I can embark."
                +"I come to a service stop where there is an inscription 'Nord Norge'. It's clear, now I'm really going North. I stretch my legs, take a tour of the souvenir shop, I would like to buy everything, but I resist, given my poor finances."
                +"I set off again, Danko, despite the oil leak, doesn't seem to experience any problems."
                +"I stop to sleep not far from the road after eating some salmon, sweet potatoes and carrots, all cooked to perfection by the Instapot."
                +"In the morning the air is full of humidity. The day before it rained heavily, the earth was soaked with water. There are still clouds in the sky but I don't think it will rain again."
                +"I leave and after a few km I meet an important point of my journey: 'The arctic circle center 66 33' N'."
                +"This is the point, which on the E6, indicates the entrance to the Arctic Circle. It means that from this point on, during the summer, the sun always remains above the horizon. Previously, the night light was strong, only Danko's curtains allowed me to sleep a wink, but from here it's officially 'sun for 24h'."
                +"The club rises in a perfect shelf, all around there is no vegetation. It's suggestive, I really like it. It really seems to go beyond a precise point that separates two distinct areas."
                +"Inside the wonderful souvenirs centre. Luckily there are so many that I don't know what to take and in the end I take nothing."
                +"I go out and still enjoy that landscape that really tastes like the North Pole, even if we are still very far away and there is still a long way to go in a northerly direction. Many campers parked in the square, but few people in the souvenir shop. I think many have spent the night here. It's a good place to sleep, maybe I'll stop by when I get back."
                +"I take the road again and finally reach Bodo, and when I go to the port, I line up behind the other campers and cars (without reservations) to reach Lofoten. The vessel should sail after 2h30. I then have time to clean up and tidy up the total mess I've left inside Danko."
                +"The engines are started and the machines with reservations get on the boat first. They wave me over to the hatch but then stop me and tell me I'm too tall. There is no more room."
                +"Nooooo, I'm angry and frustrated. I ask the young girl handling the traffic what time the next ship will be. 18h45. It seems like an eternity, I have to wait 3h45. And what do I do? Danko is all clean and tidy. I can't get out of the line because I would lose my place."
                +"I know what I have to do. I close Danko and walk to the Biltema superstore. A stupendous shop with thousands of products, a cross between Leroy Merlin, Norauto and a Camping shop. I had been to the same shop to buy oil but I hadn't had time to go around it calmly. Now I have time."
                +"I go to the shop and buy a 12v LED spotlight and some metal clamps that I have been looking for for a long time."
                +"I briskly walk back to Danko, in first position to board the next ship, and like the best MacGyver I open the rear hatches and take out all my tools."
                +"When I took off the bumper I had to give up the reverse gear and I had to make a temporary connection."
                +"I now have the spotlight and can make a perfect connection. I recover the wires, scissors, insulating tape, heat shrink tubing, cable ties, pliers, lighter. I have everything to do a good job."
                +"I feel the eyes of those around me who are waiting to embark."
                +"I feel like the coolest of the coolest. While they're there doing nothing (I want to think so, but I'm not sure), I'm here taking care of Danko."
                +"Perfect, I'm done. I turn on Danko‚Ä¶."
                +"The light doesn't work."
                +"AHHHHHHH‚Ä¶ but what ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Where did I go wrong? Yet red is the positive‚Ä¶. Black goes to mass‚Ä¶. Check the fuses. One was cooked, but functional. I replace the fuse and check the others. Everything ok, but the light doesn't work."
                +"Now I feel the weight of the others' eyes, I want to succeed before the ship arrives."
                +"I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I take the Tester. The current comes. The new light cannot fail to work."
                +"I feel the pressure, time is running out and I don't understand where the problem is. I try to double check and see that under a piece of old duct tape there is another wire. And what is this? Let me try."
                +"So is it you? I try with the tester and I realize that the negative was not grounded, but there were two wires arriving for the bulb. I clean the cables and make the connection with the heat shrink tubing. I turn the key and insert the reverse: there is light!!!! I turn to see the looks of the others waiting in the hope of receiving an ovation or at least an applause‚Ä¶. Nothing. No one looks‚Ä¶ It doesn't matter! I'm very happy, I did a great job and I didn't waste a single minute of my time, it was a job I had to do and I couldn't find the right time to do it."
                +"The ship is coming. I close everything, put all the tools in order and the young girl waves me on board."
                +"Lofoten here we come!"
