I left with all the intentions of visiting my country, but knowing that Italy has much more to offer than you can imagine, I lacked that feeling of adventure, of the unknown. That desire to take a step or a jump without seeing where to land. And so I made a choice without thinking too much about it." +
                "If I had not already prepared the trip to Italy very carefully, the tour to Tunisia was even less" +
                "so, and even now as I write I have not the faintest idea of where I will be tomorrow. I only" +
                "know where and when the ship that will take me back to Italy will be there. This journey must" +
                "be unknown to me and must reveal itself day by day." +

                "Danko because water enters, but for the second time the coachbuilder does not solve the" +
                "problem for me, he does not do what he was committed to do and it is evident that he does" +
                "not want to to do it. He has definitely lost a customer." +
                "In the following days I pass by Forli, Cervia and Rome where I meet dear friends. I take a" +
                "break by the sea to get a little short, but I don't have sunscreen or umbrella with me." +
                "The evening before embarking, it is clear that I had sunburn. I feel awful. 39.7 marks the" +
                "thermometer." +
                "I take a tachipirina, I bathe my wrists and forehead and after an hour the fever has dropped" +
                "38.2 but I am still not well. I decide to do a covid test, risk of not being able to embark for" +
                "tunisia. NEGATIVE. Well, I think to myself, I just have to let this sunstroke pass and hold on." +
                "On the 10th morning everything is still broken, but I leave for Civitavecchia where the ship" +
                "sets sail at 9 pm. But first I go shopping in a hard discount store in the area. I have found that" +
                "the people of Lazio are kind, always have a good word and are always available. I buy some" +
                "pasta, fruit, canned food. I fill the envelopes and then run off to the port." +
                "It's 9pm. The ship sails on time. I don't want to sleep in the lounge chair. There is an" +
                "overweight Tunisian who snores like a hippo and I'm still not well. I have to try to rest for a" +
                "while. I decide to place my mat under a ladder. There are few people, it is still low season." +
                "Most of the passengers are of clear Tunisian origin. Every now and then I exchange a smile" +
                "with someone, even two words in Italian or French." +
                "Arrival at the port of Tunis at 22.00 on time. My friend Claudio, an &quot;expert&quot; in Tunisia, had" +
                "warned me about customs and all the disembarkation procedures. I've never seen such a" +
                "thing in my life. At least twenty people will have checked my documents, I'm not kidding. And" +
                "if I had to describe all the steps, an A4 page would not be enough. I'll spare you, but if you" +
                "decide to come to Tunisia, take a suitcase of calm and patience with you." +
                "I booked a night in a hotel in Tunis with 26 euros, parking and breakfast. I don't feel like" +
                "sleeping in the car in the capital, and I'm too tired to leave the city." +

                "bell is half broken." +
                "I play and after about two minutes a man in his 50s opens me up, but he shows a lot more." +
                "He is a little shorter than me, but he weighed less than half. Salam Aleykoum I tell him and" +
                "he answers me accordingly." +
                "I apologize for the delay but he knows how customs work at the port. He makes me sit at the" +
                "reception after parking Danko and gives me the room key." +
                "The interior of the room is furnished in the style of the 50s. It is all a bit dilapidated but it is" +

                "Wow, just wooow." +
                "The tourists in the whole complex must have been about ten. You only hear the wind with" +
                "cicadas. It's hot, but bearable. The theater impressed me. Up to 3,500 seats." +
                "I finally manage to release all the tension of the trip. I have a smile on my face that I can't" +
                "take off. A guide notices me and smiles at me accordingly. Until now, Tunisians have all been" +

                "transparent and very fresh. A guide told me that the water is drinkable and clean. On this trip" +
                "I will do something that I have never done before. I'll take all the time I want to look at things." +
                "And even if time passes quickly and I won't be able to see everything that my friend Carlo" +
                "has suggested to me, never mind. He will mean that I will be back." +
